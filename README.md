## EVENTS
This module implements all important functions via events and __EventHandler__ event exports to the user program to customize the logic as per need other than default functionality.

EventHandler.on('prepare_data') : this event actually formats the information which is passed through the __EmailService.sendMail()__. You can redefine this event as per your business logic otherwise default function does all the formatting and file handling.

Eventhandler.on('send') : This events handles the procedure to send mail and responses accordingly on success or failure of sending mail process by emitting events __'success'__ , __'reject'__ or __'fail'__ .
